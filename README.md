Watch the to-do list <a href="https://jenniferslagt.github.io/todo-list-ts/public/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>


## Description
Iknow, another to do app. So vanilla, isn't it? But the key of this project is getting to **understand** TypeScript. This is just the beginning, more "interesting" projects will follow.
Oh and: when you achieve a task, a small confetti shotgun will be fire ðŸŽ‰ Not to mention that the computer will save the and update the tasks with localStorage.

## So, what is TypeScript?
While using _JavaScript_, we always play with data. This can be variables, functions, arrays, objects etc. But sometimes it's hard to understand what **types** of data can be passed around. 
This is what TypeScript fixes. It's basically JavaScript, but it allows us to specify the type of data being passed. Yes, that's why we call it **Type**Script! In fact: browsers can't read TS, but it will be converted to JS in order to execute it.

In this way it's way easier to prevent bugs, because TS has the ability to report errors when those types don't match. For example: if when we pass a parameter as a string into a function that expects a number, TS will report this. Very handy isn't it? Especially for bigger projects right?
